Output from Claude Sonnet 4.5 after fixing my training instabilities:

###
NaN loss after ~150 epochs is a classic training instability issue. Let me check the training code for common culprits:

Found the issue! The logit_scale parameter is learned without constraints and can explode. This is a well-known problem in CLIP training.

The problem is in model.py:328-333. Two issues:

logit_scale grows unbounded → causes overflow when exp() is applied
Norm division without epsilon → can cause NaN if features have zero/tiny norm
Here are the fixes (following OpenAI's CLIP implementation):

Fixed! Now let me also add gradient clipping to the training loop for extra stability:

Perfect! I've fixed the NaN loss issue with three critical changes:

Changes Made:
1. Clamped logit_scale (model.py:332)
Without this, logit_scale grows unbounded during training → exp() overflows → NaN. Following OpenAI CLIP, it's now capped at log(100) ≈ 4.6, which means max temperature of 100.

2. Added epsilon to norm division (model.py:328-329)
Prevents division by zero if features have tiny/zero norm.

3. Added gradient clipping (train_clip3d.py:108-110)
Prevents gradient explosion.

4. Added monitoring
Now logs train/logit_scale and validation/logit_scale to W&B
Added NaN detection with early stopping and diagnostic printing
You can now resume training from your last checkpoint. The logit_scale will be constrained and you should see stable training!

Perfect batch, resample and data inclusion tradeoff:
###
1.0mm spacing, 192³ network, batch 32 is the clear winner:
100% of scans (all ~5065 fit)
Batch 32 (great for contrastive learning)
56 GB VRAM (plenty of headroom)
1.0mm is standard resolution for cardiac CT — no meaningful information loss for fat masks
